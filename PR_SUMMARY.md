### ‚öôÔ∏è Implemented Optimizations (5 changes)

#### 1. Rust Build Optimization
**Files Modified:**
- `listen-engine/Cargo.toml`
- `listen-data/Cargo.toml`
- `listen-adapter/Cargo.toml`

**Changes:**
```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = 3        # Maximum optimization
lto = "thin"         # Link-time optimization
codegen-units = 1    # Single code generation unit
strip = true         # Strip debug symbols

[profile.dev]
incremental = true   # Faster rebuild times
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 20-30% faster release builds
- 10-15% smaller binary sizes
- Faster development iteration with incremental compilation

#### 2. TypeScript Bundle Optimization
**File Modified:** `listen-interface/vite.config.ts`

**Changes:**

  - `solana-vendor`: Solana blockchain libraries
  - `router-vendor`: Routing and state management
  - `ui-vendor`: UI animation and icons
  - `chart-vendor`: Charting libraries

**Expected Impact:**
- Better browser caching (unchanged vendors stay cached)

make docker-up      # Start Docker services
make docker-down    # Stop Docker services
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
```

**Expected Impact:**
